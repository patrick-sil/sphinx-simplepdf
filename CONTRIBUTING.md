# Contributing to Sphinx-SimplePDF

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sphinx-SimplePDF! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

> **Note for macOS users:** We recommend using the devcontainer for building and testing, as WeasyPrint has additional system dependencies that are easier to manage in a containerized environment.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/useblocks/sphinx-simplepdf.git
   cd sphinx-simplepdf
   ```

2. Install dependencies using uv:
   ```bash
   uv sync --group dev
   ```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

For parallel test execution:
```bash
uv run pytest -n auto
```

### Code Quality

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Ruff** - Linting and formatting
- **mypy** - Static type checking
- **pre-commit** - Automated checks before commits

#### Running Pre-commit Manually

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### Running Individual Checks

```bash
# Linting
uv run ruff check .

# Formatting
uv run ruff format .

# Type checking
uv run mypy .
```

### Building Documentation

```bash
uv sync --extra docs
cd docs
make html
```

### Building a PDF (Testing the Extension)

```bash
cd docs
make simplepdf
```

The generated PDF will be in `docs/_build/simplepdf/`.
